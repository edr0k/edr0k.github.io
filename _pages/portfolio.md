### Project 1: Large-Scale Analysis and Modeling of 100,000+ Galaxy Spectra üìä

* [cite_start]**Problem**: To process and analyze a massive dataset of over 100,000 galaxy spectra to extract key physical characteristics.
* [cite_start]**Skills & Tools**: `Bayesian Inference`, `MCMC`, `Statistical Modeling`, `Python (NumPy, Pandas)`, `Data Pipelines`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`[cite: 19, 20].
* **Process**:
    * [cite_start]Built end-to-end Python pipelines for efficient data cleaning, feature extraction, and visualization of the spectral data[cite: 20].
    * [cite_start]Applied advanced Bayesian methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and both parametric/non-parametric models to analyze the processed data.
* [cite_start]**Outcome**: Successfully processed and modeled a large-scale dataset, enabling the extraction of meaningful physical parameters for over 100,000 galaxies.

### Project 2: Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Parameter Estimation ü§ñ

* **Problem**: To identify the most accurate and efficient machine learning and statistical methods for estimating galaxy parameters from complex astronomical data.
* [cite_start]**Skills & Tools**: `Machine Learning`, `Statistical Modeling`, `Python`, `Interdisciplinary Collaboration`.
* **Process**:
    * [cite_start]Collaborated within an 8-member international research team to define project goals and methodologies.
    * [cite_start]Systematically benchmarked 7 different machine learning and statistical models against a standardized dataset.
* [cite_start]**Outcome**: The comparative analysis provided critical insights into model performance, establishing data-driven best practices for the international research collaboration.

### Project 3: Predictive Modeling of Stellar Cluster Properties ‚≠ê

* **Problem**: To develop accurate statistical models to determine the physical parameters (ages and metallicities) of hundreds of stellar clusters from photometric data.
* [cite_start]**Skills & Tools**: `Statistical Modeling`, `Data Analysis`, `Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)`[cite: 21, 23, 26].
* **Process**:
    * [cite_start]Applied statistical models to determine ages and metallicities for over 100 newly discovered stellar clusters[cite: 21].
    * [cite_start]Conducted a large-scale analysis of more than 400 star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]**Outcome**: Significantly improved the accuracy in stellar cluster characterization, which led to a **first-author publication in MNRAS**, a leading scientific journal[cite: 33, 34].
