[cite_start]I am a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Physics and a Master's degree in Astrophysics from the University of S√£o Paulo (USP)[cite: 5]. [cite_start]With over five years of experience, my passion lies in using machine learning, statistical modeling, and large-scale data analysis to solve complex problems and transform data into actionable insights[cite: 6, 9].

## From the Cosmos to Data: My Journey üöÄ

My path to data science began with the stars. During my academic research in astrophysics, I wasn't just observing the sky; I was tackling massive computational challenges. [cite_start]My work involved processing and analyzing over 100,000 galaxy spectra, which required building robust Python pipelines for data cleaning, feature extraction, and visualization[cite: 19, 20].

I quickly learned that understanding the universe and understanding data are deeply connected. [cite_start]To uncover the secrets hidden in noisy astronomical signals, I applied advanced techniques like Bayesian inference, MCMC, and rigorous statistical modeling[cite: 19]. [cite_start]This experience solidified my expertise in the entire data lifecycle‚Äîfrom wrangling raw information to developing predictive models and communicating results[cite: 7]. I realized my core passion was not just astrophysics, but the process of solving complex puzzles with data, which led me to pursue a career in data science.

## My Technical Approach üõ†Ô∏è

My approach is built on a solid foundation of quantitative skills and a versatile technical toolkit.

* [cite_start]**Data Analysis & Statistical Modeling**: I am highly skilled in Python and its core data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)[cite: 11]. [cite_start]My day-to-day work involves crafting analytical models and performing exploratory data analysis to uncover underlying trends[cite: 11]. [cite_start]My background in physics has given me a deep appreciation for rigorous statistical modeling and Bayesian inference, which I apply to extract meaningful insights from data[cite: 6, 11].

* [cite_start]**Machine Learning & Experimentation**: I have practical experience in applying various machine learning algorithms to solve problems[cite: 11]. [cite_start]In a collaboration with an 8-member international team, I benchmarked 7 different ML and statistical methods to determine the most effective approaches for parameter estimation[cite: 22]. [cite_start]I also have a strong understanding of A/B testing and experimental design [cite: 12][cite_start], and I am currently expanding my deep learning skills with PyTorch and TensorFlow[cite: 12].

* [cite_start]**Tools & Environment**: My preferred development environment is a Linux OS, using Git for version control and Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab for analysis and prototyping[cite: 14].

## Academic Background & Awards üéì

My academic journey has been centered at the prestigious University of S√£o Paulo (USP), where I have built my scientific and technical foundation.

* [cite_start]**PhD in Astronomy** (in progress) - University of S√£o Paulo (USP) [cite: 28]
* [cite_start]**MSc in Astronomy** - University of S√£o Paulo (USP) [cite: 29]
* [cite_start]**BSc in Physics** - University of S√£o Paulo (USP) [cite: 30]

[cite_start]In 2024, I was honored to receive the **Best Master's Thesis Award** from the XV Graduate Symposium at USP for my research work[cite: 32].

## Beyond the Data üåê

As a lifelong learner, I believe in clear communication and broad perspectives. [cite_start]I am a native Portuguese speaker and have advanced proficiency in English, particularly for technical writing and presentations[cite: 36, 37]. [cite_start]I also speak intermediate Spanish and basic German[cite: 38, 39]. Outside of work, I enjoy applying my problem-solving skills to other complex systems, whether it's through strategy games or exploring new technologies.
