* **Problem**: To identify the most accurate and efficient machine learning and statistical methods for estimating galaxy parameters from complex astronomical data.
* **Skills & Tools**: `Machine Learning`, `Statistical Modeling`, `Python`, `Interdisciplinary Collaboration`.
* **Process**:
    * Collaborated within an 8-member international research team to define project goals and methodologies.
    * Systematically benchmarked 7 different machine learning and statistical models against a standardized dataset.
* **Outcome**: The comparative analysis provided critical insights into model performance, establishing data-driven best practices for the international research collaboration.
