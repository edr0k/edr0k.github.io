* **Problem**: To process and analyze a massive dataset of over 100,000 galaxy spectra to extract key physical characteristics.
* **Skills & Tools**: `Bayesian Inference`, `MCMC`, `Statistical Modeling`, `Python (NumPy, Pandas)`, `Data Pipelines`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
* **Process**:
    * Built end-to-end Python pipelines for efficient data cleaning, feature extraction, and visualization of the spectral data.
    * Applied advanced Bayesian methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and both parametric/non-parametric models to analyze the processed data.
* **Outcome**: Successfully processed and modeled a large-scale dataset, enabling the extraction of meaningful physical parameters for over 100,000 galaxies.
