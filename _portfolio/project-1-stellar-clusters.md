* **Problem**: To develop accurate statistical models to determine the physical parameters (ages and metallicities) of hundreds of stellar clusters from photometric data.
* **Skills & Tools**: `Statistical Modeling`, `Data Analysis`, `Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)`.
* **Process**:
    * Applied statistical models to determine ages and metallicities for over 100 newly discovered stellar clusters.
    * Conducted a large-scale analysis of more than 400 star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds.
* **Outcome**: Significantly improved the accuracy in stellar cluster characterization, which led to a **first-author publication in MNRAS**, a leading scientific journal.
